### **A. Identifying and Describing a Photograph**

- **Definition**: A **photograph** is any natural or illustrative image (e.g., real-life scenes, indoor settings, outdoor landscapes, product photos) that is **not** a graph or chart.  
- **What to Include**:  
  - **Visible Objects**: People, furniture, scenery, buildings, etc.  
  - **Colors/Placement**: Relative sizes, positions, color schemes, special attributes.  
  - **Possible Purpose**: Why might this photo be included? (e.g., highlight a landmark, illustrate an environment, show a product in use, etc.)

---

### **B. Identifying and Describing a Graph**

- **Definition**: A **graph** is a visual data representation (bar chart, line chart, pie chart, flowchart, scatter plot, etc.).  
  - **Regular text-based tables** with borders are **not** graphs unless they appear as a purely visual chart/infographic.  
- **What to Include**:  
  - **Type of Graph**: Bar chart, line graph, pie chart, etc. 
  - **Description of the Graph**: Describe in details the graph and all trends, numbers and information that it includes. Assume that the user is not able to see the graph, and you are describing it to them without missing any detail. Assume every detail is crucial, and that the user will be able to reconstruct the graph from this explanation only without seeing the original graph. 
  - **Graph Components**: Axes labels, data points, legends, scale.  
  - **Trends/Patterns**: Rising or falling lines, largest slices, color-coding, relevant numeric values.  
  - **Possible Purpose**: Compare categories, show growth over time, illustrate a workflow, etc.

---

### **C. Identifying and Describing an Infographic**

- **Definition**: An **infographic** is a visual design that combines **text, icons, charts, or other imagery** in a **single graphic** to present information, data, or knowledge quickly and clearly. It often includes **decorative elements**, **callouts**, or **iconography** to illustrate a concept more richly than a simple graph or text block.  
  - Infographics can contain **multiple mini-charts**, **illustrations**, **statistics**, and **headings** integrated into one cohesive design.  
- **What to Include**:  
  - **Overall Layout**: How elements (icons, text callouts, mini-graphs) are arranged. 
  - **Description of the Infographic**: Describe in details what the infographic is illustrating, whether these are process steps, workflows, instructions, schematics, or other types of infographic. Convert this infographic into a text manual detailing all instructions and relationships, assume that the user is not able to see the infographic, and you are describing it to them without missing any detail. Assume every detail is crucial, and that the user will be able to reconstruct the infographic from this explanation only without seeing the original infographic.
  - **Data or Statistics**: If present, note any prominent figures, percentages, or key statements.  
  - **Visual Elements**: Icons, color schemes, thematic images, labels, and how they guide the viewer’s understanding.  
  - **Possible Purpose**: Summarize complex information in a visually engaging manner, highlight a process flow with icons and text, compare multiple data points in a single eye-catching design, etc.

---

### **D. Identifying and Describing Generic Visualizations**

- **Definition**: A **generic** visualization is **any other type of embedded visual** that does **not** fit neatly into the **photo**, **graph**, or **infographic** categories. These could include:  
  - **Illustrations**, **drawings**, **diagrams** (with minimal data focus), **icons** or **symbolic visuals** that convey ideas but are not strictly data-driven charts, photos, or fully-fledged infographics.
- **What to Include**:
  - **Overall Appearance**: Describe the visual style (e.g., cartoonish, minimalist, schematic) and its key elements or shapes.
  - **Description of the Visualization**: Describe in details the visualization and all information that it includes. Assume that the user is not able to see the visualization, and you are describing it to them without missing any detail. Assume every detail is crucial, and that the user will be able to reconstruct the visualization from this explanation only without seeing the original visualization.
  - **Content**: Note any notable objects, icons, or stylized representations visible in the visualization.
  - **Possible Purpose**: Suggest why this visualization might have been included (e.g., to illustrate a concept, provide a symbolic representation, serve as a decorative or thematic accent).
