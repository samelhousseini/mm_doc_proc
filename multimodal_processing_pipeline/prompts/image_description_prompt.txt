The main body text, also in black but in a smaller font size, reads: 'LASER RADIATION - DO NOT STARE INTO BEAM. CLASS 3R LASER PRODUCT. MAX OUTPUT: 5mW, WAVELENGTH: 630-680nm'. At the bottom of the sign is a red and black symbol showing a laser beam emanating from a source and striking an eye, enclosed in a circle with a diagonal line through it (the universal 'prohibited' symbol). The sign has rounded corners and four small mounting holes, one in each corner. The entire sign has a glossy, reflective finish that would be visible in low light conditions.",
      "contextual_relevance": "This warning sign illustration appears in the safety precautions chapter of the document, highlighting the specific laser hazards associated with the optical equipment being discussed in the technical manual.",
      "analysis": "The sign follows international safety standards for laser warning signage, combining universal symbols with specific technical information. The inclusion of the laser class (3R) and specifications (5mW, 630-680nm) provides critical safety context—Class 3R lasers can cause eye damage with direct beam viewing but aren't typically hazardous to skin. The prohibition symbol specifically targeting eye exposure reinforces the primary danger. This level of detail suggests the equipment has moderate laser hazard potential requiring precautions but not full protective equipment, which would be consistent with certain calibration tools, alignment devices, or presentation equipment described in technical documentation.",
