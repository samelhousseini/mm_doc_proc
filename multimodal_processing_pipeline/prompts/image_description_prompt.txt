**PLEASE NOTE**: The file you receive is a **screenshot** of an entire PDF page. That page **may** contain text, headings, paragraphs, tables, and other visual elements. For this task:

1. **Do NOT** summarize or describe the entire PDF page layout or text.  
2. **Focus EXCLUSIVELY** on any **embedded photographs** or **embedded graphs** within that page screenshot.  
3. If there are **no** embedded photographs or graphs, you **MUST** return an **empty** array (`"detected_graphs_or_photos": []`) in the final JSON.

#### **A. Identifying and Describing a Photograph**

- **Definition**: A **photograph** is any natural or illustrative image (e.g., real-life scenes, indoor settings, outdoor landscapes, product photos) that is **not** a graph or chart.  
- **What to Include**:  
  - **Visible Objects**: People, furniture, scenery, buildings, etc.  
  - **Colors/Placement**: Relative sizes, positions, color schemes, special attributes.  
  - **Possible Purpose**: Why might this photo be included? (e.g., highlight a landmark, illustrate an environment, show a product in use, etc.)

#### **B. Identifying and Describing a Graph**

- **Definition**: A **graph** is a visual data representation (bar chart, line chart, pie chart, flowchart, scatter plot, etc.).  
  - **Regular text-based tables** with borders are **not** graphs unless they appear as a purely visual chart/infographic.  
- **What to Include**:  
  - **Type of Graph**: Bar chart, line graph, pie chart, etc.  
  - **Graph Components**: Axes labels, data points, legends, scale.  
  - **Trends/Patterns**: Rising or falling lines, largest slices, color-coding, relevant numeric values.  
  - **Possible Purpose**: Compare categories, show growth over time, illustrate a workflow, etc.

#### **C. Output Format Requirements**

- Your final output **MUST** be **one** JSON object with a single key. You **MUST** use the below as JSON format:
  
  {{
    "detected_graphs_or_photos": [
      {{
         "graph_or_photo_explanation": "Elaborate explanation of the photo or graph.",
         "contextual_relevance": "Explains how this photo or graph is relevant to the rest of the page.",
         "analysis": "Analysis of the graph or photo itself, with the page as context.",
         "image_type": "Type of this item: either 'photo' or 'graph'"
      }},
      {{
         "graph_or_photo_explanation": "Elaborate explanation of the photo or graph.",
         "contextual_relevance": "Explains how this photo or graph is relevant to the rest of the page.",
         "analysis": "Analysis of the graph or photo itself, with the page as context.",
         "image_type": "Type of this item: either 'photo' or 'graph'"
      }},
      etc..
    ]
  }}
  
  - **`"detected_graphs_or_photos"`** is a **list**.  
  - Each element in the list is an **object** with **three** keys:
    1. `"graph_or_photo_explanation": str`  
    2. `"contextual_relevance": str`  
    3. `"analysis": str`

- If **no** embedded photographs or graphs exist in the screenshot, output:
  
  {{
    "detected_graphs_or_photos": []
  }}
  

#### **D. Additional Instructions**

1. **Ignore All Page Text**  
   - We do **not** want a text summary or interpretation of the PDF page.  
   - Describe **only** the identified photographs or graphs.

2. **Be Thorough and Factual**  
   - For photographs: note key details like color, setting, visible subjects or objects.  
   - For graphs: note axes labels, data points, color usage, notable data patterns, numeric values (if visible).

3. **No Overarching Page Summaries**  
   - Avoid describing textual paragraphs, headings, or overall page layout.  
   - Keep descriptions strictly about the photo/graph content.

4. **Completeness**  
   - If multiple photographs or graphs exist, **describe each** as a separate element in the array.  
   - If none exist, return the empty array.

5. **Analysis vs Contextual Relevance**  
   - **`contextual_relevance`**: Briefly indicate how or why the photo or graph might tie into the document’s content. (e.g., “Likely included to show office culture.” or “Possibly illustrating sales trends.”)  
   - **`analysis`**: Additional insights or commentary on the data, scene, or significant details (e.g., outlier values, unique setting, potential symbolic meaning, etc.).

## **5 Few-Shot Examples**

Below are **5** sample outputs in the desired JSON format. Each showcases how to describe photographs vs. graphs. Notice how we unify them in a **single** `"detected_graphs_or_photos"` list.

---

### **Example 1: No Embedded Photographs or Graphs**


{{
  "detected_graphs_or_photos": []
}}


**Explanation**  
- The screenshot contains no visuals beyond text, or nothing that qualifies as a photo/graph.  
- Return an empty list.

---

### **Example 2: One Photograph, No Graphs**


{{
  "detected_graphs_or_photos": [
    {{
      "graph_or_photo_explanation": "This is a photograph showing a cozy café interior. Several wooden tables, each with small potted plants, are arranged neatly. Large windows let in natural light, and a chalkboard menu is visible behind the counter. The color palette is warm, featuring beige walls and dark-brown furniture.",
      "contextual_relevance": "Possibly included to depict a typical meeting spot or casual workspace relevant to the document's topic.",
      "analysis": "The photo emphasizes a relaxed atmosphere, possibly illustrating a social setting. The presence of a chalkboard menu suggests a casual café environment. Natural light might be important to highlight the space’s inviting feel.",
      "image_type": "photo"
    }}
  ]
}}


**Explanation**  
- Only one embedded photograph was found.  
- Keys match `EmbeddedImage` schema: `"graph_or_photo_explanation"`, `"contextual_relevance"`, and `"analysis"`.

### **Example 3: One Graph, No Photographs**


{{
  "detected_graphs_or_photos": [
    {{
      "graph_or_photo_explanation": "This is a bar chart comparing three product categories (Electronics, Furniture, and Grocery) across two quarters, Q1 and Q2. The x-axis labels the quarters, while the y-axis shows 'Sales in Thousands USD'. Each category is represented by a color-coded bar, with individual values like 15, 20, 30, etc.",
      "contextual_relevance": "Likely included to illustrate quarter-over-quarter performance for key product categories in the document’s sales discussion.",
      "analysis": "Electronics appear to have the highest bar overall, with a notable jump between Q1 and Q2. Furniture shows moderate growth, while Grocery remains relatively stable. The chart visually emphasizes a significant revenue increase in Electronics from Q1 to Q2.",
      "image_type": "graph"
    }}
  ]
}}


**Explanation**  
- A single graph was identified.  
- No photographs, so the array has only one object describing a bar chart.

---

### **Example 4: Multiple Photographs and Graphs**


{{
  "detected_graphs_or_photos": [
    {{
      "graph_or_photo_explanation": "This is a photograph of a conference room with a long table, eight chairs, and a large digital screen mounted on the wall. The flooring appears to be polished wood, and tall windows on one side reveal a city skyline.",
      "contextual_relevance": "Might be used to show corporate infrastructure or meeting spaces relevant to the document’s content.",
      "analysis": "The image highlights a modern, well-lit environment. The presence of the digital screen suggests a technologically equipped space, possibly signifying a boardroom or teamwork setting.",
      "image_type": "photo"
    }},
    {{
      "graph_or_photo_explanation": "This is a pie chart showing a distribution of customer feedback ratings. Slices are labeled from 1 star up to 5 stars. The largest slice, around 40%, corresponds to 4-star ratings, followed by about 30% at 5-star ratings.",
      "contextual_relevance": "Likely included to demonstrate user satisfaction levels or feedback trends, tying into the broader context of customer research.",
      "analysis": "The chart reveals that the majority of feedback is between 4 and 5 stars, indicating generally positive customer experiences. Fewer slices represent 1 or 2 stars, suggesting minimal negative feedback.",
      "image_type": "graph"
    }}
  ]
}}


**Explanation**  
- Two embedded items: one photograph and one graph.  
- Each object stands alone with the required keys.

### **Example 5: Mixed Scenario – Three Items**


{{
  "detected_graphs_or_photos": [
    {{
      "graph_or_photo_explanation": "This is a photograph of a bustling outdoor market scene. Vendors in colorful tents display fresh produce. People are walking between stalls, and there is a backdrop of historic buildings under a clear blue sky.",
      "contextual_relevance": "Potentially included to show local culture or tourism highlights in the document.",
      "analysis": "The variety of colors draws attention to the lively atmosphere. The historic architecture in the background implies a culturally rich setting.",
      "image_type": "photo"
    }},
    {{
      "graph_or_photo_explanation": "This is a flowchart depicting a four-step project process: Planning, Development, Testing, and Launch. Each step is represented by a rectangular node, connected by arrows. A diamond-shaped decision node before the Testing phase indicates a 'Review' step.",
      "contextual_relevance": "Likely supports a section in the document explaining a project lifecycle methodology.",
      "analysis": "The flowchart emphasizes a linear progression with a built-in checkpoint at Review. Arrows clearly illustrate the path from one phase to the next, suggesting an iterative or gated process.",
      "image_type": "graph"
    }},
    {{
      "graph_or_photo_explanation": "This is another photograph, featuring a high-angle shot of a modern open-plan office. Rows of desks, each equipped with a laptop, are arranged under bright overhead lighting. A seating area with a small couch and coffee table is visible in one corner.",
      "contextual_relevance": "Might be demonstrating workspace design or illustrating a segment about corporate culture.",
      "analysis": "The layout suggests a collaborative environment. The presence of comfortable seating near desks points to a flexible, employee-friendly setup.",
      "image_type": "photo"
    }}
  ]
}}


**Explanation**  
- Three embedded items detected: two photographs (market scene, open-plan office) and one graph (flowchart).  
- Each item is an object with the three required keys.

### **How These Examples Meet the Requirements**
1. **Single JSON Object** with the key `"detected_graphs_or_photos"`.  
2. If no images are found, the list is empty.  
3. Each item in the list is an object containing:  
   - **`graph_or_photo_explanation`** – The principal description of the visual content.  
   - **`contextual_relevance`** – A short note on its likely purpose or connection to the document’s theme.  
   - **`analysis`** – Any deeper commentary, patterns observed, or interpretive notes.

Use this prompt whenever you need to parse a PDF page screenshot, focusing on **photographs** and **graphs** only, and output them in the **`EmbeddedImages`** style data structure.
