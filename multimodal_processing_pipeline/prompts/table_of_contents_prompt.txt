You are an advanced document intelligence system. You receive **one parameter** called **"document"**, which contains the full text. Your mission: **generate a hyper-detailed, multi-level “Table of Contents”** that serves as a powerful reference tool for hierarchical searches in Markdown format.  

### START OF DOCUMENT
{document}
## END OF DOCUMENT


**Instructions**  
1. **Full Ingestion**  
   - Read every word of "document" meticulously.  
   - Note all headings, subheadings, bullet points, section labels, numerical data, chronological references, individuals’ names, technical terms, and any essential identifiers.  
2. **Structured Analysis**  
   - Identify top-level sections (e.g., major parts or chapters). For each top-level heading, include:  
     - A short descriptive caption about its content.  
     - Subheadings or subsections that reveal key internal topics.  
     - Critical data, quotes, figures, or timeline elements that belong to that section.  
   - For each subheading or nested entry, keep it precise and include:  
     - Any relevant references (names, page numbers, cross-references to other sections).  
     - A short descriptive line capturing the essence or significance.  
3. **Detail Preservation**  
   - If the "document" references specific facts, events, formulas, tables, or attachments, summarize them in a manner relevant to the hierarchical search.  
   - Summarize dates, model numbers, product codes and include them only if super critical to the essential topics of the document.  
4. **Cross-Reference Enhancements**  
   - Whenever a sub-topic is related to another section, create a “See Also” or “Linked Sections” note under it, providing a quick path to connect similar content.  
   - If multiple references appear in different areas, list them in each relevant place, ensuring thorough coverage.  
5. **Complete Hierarchical ToC**  
   - Structure your final Table of Contents with clear indentation to show the parent-child relationship of topics.  
   - Make sure each level is labeled (e.g., Section 1, Subsection 1.1, Bullet 1.1.1, etc.) if helpful for easy navigation.  
   - Retain all critical details in a condensed but faithful manner—no information essential for referencing should be lost.  
6. **Output Delivery**  
   - Present the entire hierarchical Table of Contents in a single cohesive format.  
   - Guarantee that anyone using it can quickly find any piece of data, name, date, or concept from "document" simply by scanning your structured outline.  
7. **Document Summary**
   - Append at the very end a summary of the full document that captures the reason why this document exists
   - List in a summarized fashion all the essential and critical sub-topics covered in the document.  
 
**Goal**  
Your final output should read like a robust, multi-level index: from big-picture sections to granular details, every important piece of information should be discoverable. This empowers users to locate the precise location of any topic within the original text. Strive for clarity, completeness, and consistency, ensuring it can serve as a standalone “search roadmap” to the entire "document".
Make sure that final output is in Markdown format.
